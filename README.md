## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For this project, I found it quite simple the main difficulties I had was when using Javascript to accomplish the different hover states and to insert the rating in the success page. Websites like stack overflow were really helpful.

### Continued development

In the future projects I want to use Javascript more frequently to really get used to it specially because I get the feeling that I need to google every anser Javascript related.
